## How to compile and run

From the project root (example uses zsh):

Compile a single file:
```bash
cd "/Users/vedant/Dsa-work/Data Structures/Questions"
cd "path/to/Dsa-work/Data Structures/Questions"
java ArithmeticOperationsUsingStack
```

If a class is in the default package (no package declaration) you can run it by name as shown. If you add packages, compile with `javac -d .` and run with the fully qualified class name.

Tip for VS Code: open the folder, press `Ctrl+` ` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal, and use the same `javac`/`java` commands.

## Git / SSH usage

Use SSH for a smoother push/pull experience. Example flow:

1. Ensure your SSH key is added to the agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

2. Confirm connection to GitHub:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

3. Make and push changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

If push is rejected because the remote has new commits, fetch and rebase or pull and resolve conflicts first:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push
```

If you prefer HTTPS, generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub and use it as the password when prompted.

## Contributing

- Keep code simple and well‑commented.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods.
- Open a PR if you plan to add or refactor a larger section.

## Notes
- Many examples are single-file Java programs (default package) for learning. Converting to packages and adding a small build script (Maven/Gradle) is a good next step if you want to scale this project.
