## Files

- `ROADMAP.md`: Contains the complete DSA learning path with topics and resources
- `PROGRESS.md`: Tracks completed tasks, ongoing work, and upcoming topics
- `.gitkeep`: Ensures this directory is tracked in git

## Usage

The mentor will:
1. Track progress in these files
2. Update learning paths as needed
3. Add new resources and guidance
4. Review and provide feedback through GitHub issues and pull requests

## Note

Please do not modify or delete files in this directory. They are maintained by your mentor to help track your learning journey.
